# this config is written in groups of 3 lines with space seperated values on each line

# line 1 is the depth integer and the directory to search ( depth 0 is fully recursive)
# line 2 in the terms included in the search (grep)
# line 3 is terms to be excluded in the search (grep)
# leave line2 or line3 blank if you have no terms to include or exclude respectively
#
# searching only the user's home directory itself (depth 1) including rc like .bashrc and .X like .Xresources
# excludes .Xauthority as its only a token and won't need user editting or viewing
1 $HOME

.Xauthority
#
# user's config folder often loaded with files the user will not edit so here it's useful to exclude quite a bit
